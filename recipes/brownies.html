    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, 
        fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These 
        brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have 
        what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.

        I know that saying these are the “best brownies, ever” is a 
        bold statement, but we truly believe it. I love brownies that 
        are rich and extra chocolaty. These brownies with dense, fudgy 
        middles and crinkly tops absolutely deliver! These are perfect 
        for boxed brownie lovers — the dense, moist, and fudgy texture 
        is not all that different from what you can expect from the boxed 
        mixes. It get’s better, though. These brownies are much more 
        flavorful than anything made from a box. They taste amazing.

    <h3>Ingredients and Equipment</h3>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Equipment</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Spoon</li>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Small saucepan</li>
        <li>8-inch square pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat 
            to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch 
            square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving 
            an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies 
            from the pan.</li>
        <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water 
            about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium 
            heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water.</li>
        <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and 
            the mixture is quite warm.</li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes 
            or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
        <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use 
            a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick 
            and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon 
            or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks 
            slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by 
            inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished 
            baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
